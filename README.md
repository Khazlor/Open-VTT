# Open-VTT
Open source Virtual Tabletop based on Godot game engine. Basis for bachelor's thesis.

Project is WIP.

Virtual table top for Dungeons and Dragons and other game systems. Support for both online and offline play.
Includes integrated map editor for fast creation of maps - vastly improving DM's improvisation capability without wasting play time. 
Support for unlimited layers on maps for seamless multi-level map design, dynamic lighting, inventory system, spellbooks and more.

Goal is to implement modern video game features into a more traditional VTT formula.

Will work on both desktop and android including crossplay.
